# Mr. Krabs' money tracker 

A small, mobile-first web app that shows how much you're earning in realtime while you work. Enter an hourly wage, tap Start, and the app counts up your earnings (and stores shifts when you tap End).

Key files
- `wage_against_machine.html` â€” the single-page web app (HTML, CSS, JS all inline). Open this in a browser to run.

Live demo

Notes
- The app stores shifts in browser localStorage so totals persist on the same device/browser.
- The UI is mobile-first and optimized for portrait (9:16) display.

If you need local development instructions or a deploy guide, I can add those on request.
